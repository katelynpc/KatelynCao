IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

I want to make a VU meter using LEDs and a freeform circuit design.

## Educational Value Added

I plan to use this to gain experience finding the right values for resistors, caps, etc. I also want to learn how to solder freeform circuits as well as how to use microcontrollers.
